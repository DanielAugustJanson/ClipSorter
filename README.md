### ClipSorter v0.5
# A basic Python script to rename video clips in the given folder

# Made since I am annoyed as how long OBS names are for files

## Tldr:

1. Drag to folder where clips are stored
2. Run script
3. Input your name Prefix
4. Select naming sceheme
5. Check renaming preview before proceeding
6. Done

Just incase it also generates a log of files it renamed. 



By no mean am I responsible for this Hill Billy solution :3
